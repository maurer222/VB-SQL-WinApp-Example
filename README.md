# VB-SQL-WinApp-Example
Sample project demonstrating the use of VB.Net and SQL Server

This project is built on a series of videos by VB Toolbox https://youtu.be/7Z4BGEHD-JQ

The application performs all of the basic CRUD operations on data stored on a local SQL Server. It allows users to add, update and delete users (ID, Username, Password, 
Active/Inactive flag, admin flag, and date they were put into the database)

The application will also display a list of inventory items and properties that are stored on a different table on the server.
